Once, in a valley where moonlight brushed the grass and the stars seemed close enough to touch, there lived a unicorn named Astra. Her horn glowed with a pale silver light, and her mane shimmered like thread-woven rain. Every night she wandered to the Night Meadow to make sure all the sleeping creatures slept well, and to share a quiet song that could soothe the heart.

Astra loved the soft hush of the world after dark. She listened to the crickets practicing their tiny tunes, the distant wind brushing through the pine trees, and the gentle splash of the brook that carried little dreams on its surface. When she sang, the sound came out as a silver ribbon of light trailing behind her, and it wrapped around the sleepy meadow like a warm blanket.

One night, as the dew glittered on the tall grass, Astra found a small hedgehog tucked into a circle of mushrooms. His name was Thimble, and he looked very weary, though his eyes tried not to show it. He wriggled his tiny nose and sighed, “I can’t sleep, Astra. My dreams feel tangled, and I’m afraid I’ll wake up with a fright.”

Astra settled beside him and lowered her voice to a soft murmur. “Tell me what worries you, little one.” Thimble explained that shadows in the corners of his cozy burrow had begun to feel like shapes that might bite, and the thought of waking in darkness made his heart beat like a drum.

The unicorn smiled with gentleness. “The night is a friend, Thimble. It holds you gently, like a mother holds a child. Let me tell you a story with a lullaby in it, and I’ll guide you back to sleep.”

She drew close, and from her horn poured a cool, silver glow that spread across the mushrooms and the hedgehog’s little bed. The glow wasn’t bright or loud; it sang in a way that sounded like wind chimes touched by a breeze. Astra began to hum, and her voice carried a melody of raindrops on leaves, of faraway rivers, and of the soft rustle of pine needles.

“Once, the night wore a coat of starlight,” she sang, “and every creature of the valley learned to listen for the quiet promise in the dark. Shadows are only sleep’s gentle cloak, making sure dreams stay warm and safe. If you close your eyes and breathe with the trees, you’ll see that you are already held by the night.”

Thimble listened, his worries loosening like threads unweaving themselves. The hedgehog’s breath slowed, and his prickles relaxed into a soft stillness. The little shadows in his burrow seemed to drift away, leaving only the kind, familiar shapes of daisies and mushrooms and the soft glow of Astra’s horn.

As the lullaby continued, Astra’s light brightened just a touch and then settled into a quiet glow, like moonlight poured into a teacup and set down on the night’s table. The shadows trembled for a moment and then melted into the silver mist, revealing a calm, friendly darkness that felt safe rather than scary.

Thimble’s eyes drifted shut, and his breathing evened out into a slow, easy rhythm. A small sigh of relief escaped him, and the hedgehog nestled deeper into his bed of moss and leaves. The meadow grew still, the frogs’ song dwindled to a hush, and even the fireflies paused to listen to Astra’s lullaby.

When the song came to an end, Astra spoke softly, almost in a whisper. “Sleep now, little friend. The night will keep you safe until dawn, and I will be here on the hill to greet the waking sun.” She watched as Thimble’s chest rose and fell with peaceful sleep, a tiny smile on his face.

With Thimble resting, Astra rose and padded softly through the meadow. She paused by the brook and looked up at the sky, where the stars blinked like patient watchmen. The valley glowed with a gentle, comforting light, and the air carried the faint perfume of wildflowers that bloomed only after dusk.

Astra found her favorite resting spot on a small hill, where the world felt stitched together with quiet. She curled her neck and settled her head on the soft grass, her horn resting lightly atop the earth as if it, too, wished to dream. The night hummed a lullaby back to her, and she let the rhythm carry her into a light sleep.

The valley slept in a velvet stillness, held by the soft, reassuring glow of Astra’s silver light. The stars kept their watch, and every creature drifted toward dreamland in a peace that felt old and true.

And if you listen very closely, you can almost hear the lullaby still, carried by the breeze and the whispering leaves. Good night, little one. May your dreams be gentle, and may you wake into a bright, new day, knowing you are loved and watched over by a unicorn who brings sleep with the moon’s own glow.


从前，在一个月光轻抚草地、星星近得仿佛触手可及的山谷里，住着一只名叫 Astra 的独角兽。她的角散发着淡淡的银色光芒，鬃毛像雨丝编织而成般闪闪发亮。每天夜里，她都会漫步到夜之草地，确保所有沉睡的生灵都能安然入眠，并哼唱一首能抚慰心灵的宁静歌谣。

Astra 喜爱黑夜降临后世界的那份柔和静谧。她聆听着蟋蟀们练习着它们的小调，远处风吹过松树的声响，以及小溪潺潺的流水声——溪面上似乎承载着一个个小小的梦境。当她歌唱时，歌声化作一缕银色的光带，尾随其后，像一条温暖的毯子般包裹着沉睡的草地。

一天夜里，露水在高高的草丛上闪闪发光，Astra 发现一只小刺猬蜷缩在一圈蘑菇中间。他叫 Thimble，看起来十分疲惫，尽管他努力不让自己的眼神流露出来。他抽动着小小的鼻子，叹了口气：“Astra，我睡不着。我的梦乱糟糟的，我怕自己会惊醒，吓一大跳。”

Astra 在他身边坐下，声音轻柔得像一声低语：“小家伙，告诉我你在担心什么。”Thimble 解释说，他舒适洞穴角落里的阴影开始变得像会咬人的怪物，一想到在黑暗中醒来，他的心跳就像打鼓一样。

独角兽温柔地笑了：“Thimble，夜晚是朋友呀。它会温柔地抱着你，就像妈妈抱着孩子一样。我给你讲个带摇篮曲的故事吧，我会引导你入睡的。”

她凑近了些，角上涌出一股清凉的银色光芒，洒落在蘑菇群和刺猬的小窝上。这光芒不刺眼，也不喧闹，它的“歌声”就像微风拂过风铃那般动听。Astra 开始哼唱，她的歌声里融入了雨滴打在树叶上的旋律、远方河流的潺潺声，以及松针轻轻的沙沙声。

“从前，夜晚披着一件星光外套，”她唱道，“山谷里的每一个生灵都学会了聆听黑暗中那份宁静的承诺。阴影不过是睡眠的温柔披风，确保梦境温暖又安全。如果你闭上眼睛，跟着树木一起呼吸，就会发现自己早已被夜晚拥在怀中。”

Thimble 听着，他的忧虑像松开的线一样渐渐消散。小刺猬的呼吸放缓了，身上的刺也放松下来，归于平静。他洞穴里的小阴影似乎都飘走了，只留下雏菊、蘑菇这些亲切熟悉的身影，以及 Astra 那角上柔和的光芒。

摇篮曲继续着，Astra 的光芒稍稍亮了一点，然后又归于柔和的光晕，就像把月光倒进了茶杯，放在夜晚的桌子上。阴影颤抖了片刻，随后融入银色的薄雾中，显露出一片平静、友善的黑暗——它让人感到安全，而非恐惧。

Thimble 的眼睛慢慢闭上，呼吸变得均匀舒缓。一声小小的释然叹息从他口中逸出，他往自己的苔藓和树叶小床上又缩了缩。草地变得一片寂静，青蛙的歌声渐渐平息，就连萤火虫也停下来聆听 Astra 的摇篮曲。

歌声结束时，Astra 轻声细语，几乎像耳语一般：“睡吧，小友。夜晚会守护你直到黎明，而我会在小山上迎接初升的太阳。”她看着 Thimble 胸口随着安稳的睡眠起伏，脸上还带着一丝浅浅的微笑。

Thimble 安睡后，Astra 站起身，轻轻穿过草地。她在小溪边停下，抬头望向天空，星星像耐心的守望者一样眨着眼睛。山谷被一种温柔又令人安心的光芒笼罩着，空气中弥漫着只有在黄昏后才绽放的野花的淡淡芬芳。

Astra 在一座小山上找到了她最喜欢的休息处，在那里，整个世界仿佛被宁静缝合在一起。她蜷起脖子，将头搁在柔软的草地上，角轻轻靠在大地上，仿佛它也渴望进入梦乡。夜晚也向她回哼着摇篮曲，她随着这旋律渐渐进入了浅眠。

山谷在一片丝绒般的寂静中沉睡，被 Astra 那银色的温柔光芒守护着。星星继续它们的守望，每一个生灵都在一种古老而真挚的安宁中步入梦乡。

要是你仔细聆听，几乎还能听到那首摇篮曲，它随着微风和低语的树叶飘荡。晚安，小家伙。愿你的梦境温柔美好，愿你在新的一天醒来时，知道自己被爱着，被一只带着月光般光芒带来安睡的独角兽守护着。
